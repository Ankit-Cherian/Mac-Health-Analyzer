For system-level access (viewing launch daemons, managing system processes):

```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```

## 🎯 Interface Guide

### ⚡ STARTUP Tab
- View all startup items in a searchable table
- Filter by type (Login Items, Launch Agents, Launch Daemons)
- Toggle items on/off with smooth animated switches
- Search functionality for quick filtering

### ⚙ PROCESSES Tab
- Monitor all running processes
- View CPU and memory usage in real-time
- Search processes by name
- Filter system processes
- Force quit processes with one click
- Color-coded resource usage (green = low, amber = medium, pink = high)

### ◉ SYSTEM Tab (NEW!)
- **Circular Gauges** - CPU, Memory, and Process count with animated needles
- **Real-Time Charts** - Live graphs showing CPU and memory trends over the last 60 data points
- **Resource Bar Charts** - Top 8 processes by CPU and memory usage
- **System Information Cards** - Total RAM, CPU cores, startup items count
- **Status Indicator** - Online/error status in the top right

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Neon Green `#00ff41` - Matrix-inspired accent
- **Secondary**: Electric Cyan `#00f5ff` - Futuristic highlights
- **Tertiary**: Hot Pink `#ff006e` - Critical alerts
- **Warning**: Amber `#ffbe0b` - Medium priority
- **Background**: Deep Black `#0a0a0f` - Terminal darkness

### Typography
- **Display Font**: Chakra Petch (Thai-inspired geometric)
- **Secondary**: Rajdhani (Indo-Arabic inspired)
- **Special**: Orbitron (Futuristic headers)
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (Code and metrics)

### Charts & Visualizations
- **Real-time Line Charts** - Smooth 60-point scrolling graphs with neon glow
- **Circular Gauges** - 360° animated gauges with gradient fills
- **Horizontal Bar Charts** - Gradient-filled bars with percentage display
- **Color Coding**:
  - 0-50% = Neon Green (optimal)
  - 50-80% = Amber (warning)
  - 80-100% = Hot Pink (critical)

## ⚙️ Performance

- **Chart Update Rate**: 2 seconds (configurable)
- **Process Limit**: 100 processes displayed for optimal performance
- **Animation Frame Rate**: 60 FPS
- **Memory Efficient**: Charts use rolling buffers with 60-point maximum

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

The application automatically:
- Downloads custom fonts on first run
- Caches launchctl results for faster startup
- Uses signal blocking during updates to prevent UI freezing
- Refreshes only the active tab to conserve resources

## 📝 Notes

- Custom fonts (Chakra Petch, Rajdhani, Orbitron, JetBrains Mono) download automatically on first run
- Some operations require administrator privileges
- Charts update every 2 seconds when System tab is active
- Process table displays up to 100 processes for optimal performance
- All visualizations use hardware acceleration when available
