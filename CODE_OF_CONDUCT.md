# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be respectful. Be kind. Don't be a jerk.

## The Longer Version

This project is meant to be a welcoming space for anyone who wants to contribute or use the software. Here's what I expect:

### Do:
- Be respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community and the project
- Show empathy towards others
- Help newcomers feel welcome

### Don't:
- Use offensive, discriminatory, or harassing language
- Troll, insult, or make personal attacks
- Publish others' private information without permission
- Act in ways that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

If someone's being a problem, I'll handle it. Depending on the severity:
- First offense: A friendly warning
- Continued issues: Temporary ban from the project
- Serious violations: Permanent ban

## Reporting

If you see something that violates this code of conduct, you can:
- Open an issue (if you're comfortable with it being public)
- Email me directly (find my contact in my GitHub profile)

I'll do my best to handle reports fairly and discreetly.

## Attribution

This code of conduct is adapted from general open source community standards and common sense.
